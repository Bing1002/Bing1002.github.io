My name is Bing Zha (Chinese name: "查 冰") and I am currently a PhD student in the [Photogrammetric Computer Vision Lab](https://pcvlab.engineering.osu.edu/) in the [Department of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering](https://ceg.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Alper Yilmaz](https://ceg.osu.edu/people/yilmaz.15).

My main research is about computer vision and deep learning. Specifically, I am now working on topological localization problem using deep neural networks.   

Meanwhile, I am also earning Graduate Minor in Statistics from [Department of Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu/) and Graduate Minor in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Track) from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/).
