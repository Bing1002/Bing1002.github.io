My name is Bing Zha. I am a Machine Learning Engineer at **Torc Robotics**, where I work on perception and geometry-centric learning systems for autonomous long-haul trucks. My current focus is on camera-based localization, 3D geometric perception, and large-scale deep learning systems that enable safe and reliable autonomy.


Previously, I was a Research Scientist at Motorola Solutions, developing deep learning–based perception models for large-scale video surveillance and intelligent sensing platforms.

I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from the [Photogrammetric Computer Vision Lab](https://u.osu.edu/pcvlab/) in the [Department of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering](https://ceg.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Alper Yilmaz](https://ceg.osu.edu/people/yilmaz.15). During my Ph.D., I also earned a **Graduate Minor in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Track)** from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/).

My research centers on **computer vision and deep learning for geolocalization and 3D reconstruction**, with a strong foundation in photogrammetry, multi-view geometry, and large-scale learning systems. Today, I apply and extend these ideas to autonomous driving, working at the intersection of **perception, geometry, learning, and scalable systems** to build robust perception and world-modeling pipelines.
